## 🚀 About Me
I'm Ibrahim Badawy — a cybersecurity-driven problem solver who loves building, breaking, and securing systems.  
I specialize in **penetration testing**, **automation with Python**, **network security**, and **accessible technology for the visually impaired community**.

I’m currently building my career at **Microsoft Egypt**, where I'm developing strong technical and communication skills through real, high-scale enterprise support operations.

## 🌟 My Accessibility Journey
I am a **visually impaired cybersecurity learner**, and I’m constantly challenging myself to overcome accessibility barriers in technical tools, platforms, and learning resources.

Instead of letting these limitations stop me, I turn them into motivation.

I test, analyze, and work around accessibility issues in cybersecurity tools — and whenever I solve something, I share it with my community so they don’t have to struggle through the same problems.

My mission is simple:

**Make cybersecurity learning more accessible for the visually impaired community — by sharing real solutions, saving time, and empowering others.**
